# Health Costs Prediction with Linear Regression

This project aims to predict health costs using a regression algorithm. The dataset contains information about different individuals, including their healthcare costs. The regression model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided in the `insurance.csv` file. It includes features such as age, sex, BMI, smoker status, region, and charges.

## Getting Started

The jupyter notebook contains the link to the dataset along with the starter code. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Model Architecture

The regression model is a simple neural network with one hidden layer. You can customize the architecture based on your requirements.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics. The training history is visualized to monitor the model's performance over epochs.
